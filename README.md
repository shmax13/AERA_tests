# AERA

This is a fork from https://github.com/IIIM-IS/AERA.  
Here, I'm creating tests for AERA as part of my master's thesis.  
Work in progress!

## Requirements
- gmock 1.11 (installable via nuget in Visual Studio)
- Test adapter for Google Test (Visual Studio extension)
- building AERA once in "Debug" solution configuration, with WITH_DETAIL_OID enabled.
