; Doc - Annex 1 - 2.3 - Sets

; not much to test here, see also tests for 2.2 and 2.5.

; set, containing list elements
x:(ont 1) [[SYNC_ONCE now 0 forever root nil]]

; according to spec, elements should only be separated by exactly one separator. however,
; the following also works (with blank space + CR) //TODO
y:(ont 1) [[SYNC_ONCE  
now 0 forever root nil]
]

; and even multiple CRs work:
z:(ont 1) [ [ SYNC_ONCE   
now   0


forever root nil]
]
