; Programs react to incoming objects. A program defines a pattern of
; time-constrained object sequences, including patterns and guards (conditions)
; on the individual incoming objects and produces new objects built from the
; incoming ones, said new objects being called productions. Programs are
; reactive, i.e. they perform as described whenever incoming objects match the
; time-pattern and guards. The transformation of inputs into productions is called
; reduction.
; Programs are state-less and have no side-effects.
